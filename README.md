#### Is the Colorado Unemployment rate in line with the National Unemplyment rate?
When looking at the unemployment data, I was able to find that the Colorado and National Unemployment data was corelated via a line graph and a scatter plot. I wanted to see if the Colorado unemployment was a good sample of the national unemployment data.

#### Is there a direct correlation with the Colorado Unemployment rate and the National Unemployment Rate?
When looking at the scatter plot for the unemployment data, there was a correlation of the r-value of 0.886 which meant that Colorado was a good sample size for the national data set.
