### Alcohol Sales

Utilizing the dataset from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the covid dataset from Johns Hopkins, I wanted to see if there was any correlation between the alcohol sales in the US and the number of confirmed covid cases, the number of covid deaths, and the testing rate for the states included in the alcohol sales dataset. Furthermore, I wanted to see if there was an increase in alcohol sales in 2020 compared to the past 3 years (2017-2019). Based on my findings, I can conclude that:
-alcohol sales per capita did not have a significant correlation with the number of confirmed covid cases as the r2 value is .004. 
-alcohol sales per capita did not have a significant correlation with the number of confirmed covid deaths as the r2 value is .002. 
-alcohol sales per capita did not have a significant correlation with the testing rate of US states as the r2 value is .013.
It can also be concluded that there was an increase in alcohol sales per capita for 2020 compared to the previous three years as seen in the included line plot.
